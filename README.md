# Clothing-Shop-Simulation-Using-IPCs
# Clothing Shop Simulation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a **multi-process Clothing Shop** using **FIFO (named pipes) for Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**. It consists of three independent processes that communicate with each other to handle shop management, customer orders, and inventory updates in real time.

### **🛠 Components**
The project consists of **three main processes**:

1. **Shop Process** 🏬  
   - Manages the shop's inventory.
   - Reads the initial stock and prices from a file.
   - Displays inventory periodically.
   - Handles orders from customers.
   - Processes restocking and price updates from the inventory manager.

2. **Customer Process** 🛒
   - Allows a user to place an order.
   - Takes input for item name and quantity.
   - Sends the order request to the shop via FIFO.

3. **Inventory Manager Process** 📦
   - Allows a user (admin) to update stock and prices.
   - Takes input for item name, quantity to add, and new price.
   - Sends updates to the shop via FIFO.

## ⚙️ How It Works (Step-by-Step)
### **1️⃣ Initialization**
- The **Shop process** starts first.
- It reads the **initial inventory** from `inventory.txt`.
- The shop begins **displaying inventory periodically**.

### **2️⃣ Customer Process (Placing Orders)**
- The customer enters the **item name and quantity**.
- The order request is **sent via FIFO** to the Shop.
- The shop processes the request and updates inventory.

### **3️⃣ Inventory Manager Process (Restocking & Price Updates)**
- Admin enters **item name, quantity to add, and new price**.
- The update request is **sent via FIFO** to the Shop.
- The shop processes the update and modifies inventory.

### **4️⃣ Shop Processing (Main Process)**
- Listens for customer orders and processes them.
- Listens for inventory updates and applies changes.
- Continually **displays updated inventory**.

## 🛠 Setup & Installation
### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mohamedaymankills/Clothing-Shop-Simulation-Using-IPCs.git
cd Clothing-Shop-Simulation-Using-IPCs
```

### **2️⃣ Compile the Code**
Use the provided `Makefile` to compile all programs:
```sh
make
or
gcc- o shop shop.c
gcc -o customer customer.c
gcc -o inventory_manager inventory_manager .c
```
This will generate three executable files:
- `shop`
- `customer`
- `inventory_manager`

### **3️⃣ Run the Shop Process (First Terminal)**
```sh
./shop
```
This will start the shop and display the inventory periodically.

### **4️⃣ Run the Customer Process (Second Terminal)**
```sh
./customer
```
The program will prompt you to enter an order:
```sh
Enter item name and quantity (e.g., Shirt 2):
```

### **5️⃣ Run the Inventory Manager Process (Third Terminal)**
```sh
./inventory_manager
```
The program will prompt you to enter an update:
```sh
Enter item name, quantity to add, and new price (e.g., Shirt 5 19.99):
```

---

## 📌 Example Run
### **Shop (Terminal 1)**
```sh
--- Shop Inventory ---
Shirt - 10 units - $20.50
Jeans - 5 units - $45.99
Jacket - 3 units - $79.99
```

### **Customer (Terminal 2)**
```sh
Enter item name and quantity (e.g., Shirt 2): Shirt 2
```

### **Shop Updates Inventory**
```sh
Processing order: Shirt 2
Order completed! Remaining: Shirt - 8 units
```

### **Inventory Manager (Terminal 3)**
```sh
Enter item name, quantity to add, and new price (e.g., Shirt 5 19.99): Shirt 5 19.99
```

### **Shop Updates Inventory**
```sh
Restocking: Shirt +5 units, New Price: $19.99
```

## 🛠 Inter-Process Communication (IPC) using FIFO
- The **Customer Process** sends orders to `FIFO_ORDER`.
- The **Inventory Manager** sends updates to `FIFO_UPDATE`.
- The **Shop Process** reads from both FIFOs and updates inventory accordingly.

---

## 🎯 Future Improvements
✅ Support multiple customers simultaneously.
✅ Add a graphical user interface (GUI).
✅ Implement more IPC methods (shared memory, message queues).
